# This file contains the environment variables for the docker-compose.yml file
# The docker-compose.yml file also requires the variable COMMIT_SHORT_SHA to be set.
# This is done:
#    - in the Makefiles when running locally
#    - in the CI yml file's deploy: job just before the 'docker compose up' command.
#
# Note: this file is also used in the run_ci_locally.sh script's act flag: --var-file=.env
